## Absolute Path Implementation

This repo supports the usage of absolute paths for file and folder creation. By configuring the project with absolute paths, you can specify the exact location where the feature files and folders should be created.
# Feature Files and Folders Creator

This script automates the creation of files and folders for a feature in a project. It helps in scaffolding new features and organizing them in the project structure.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the script file.
2. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script file is located.

## Usage

To create files and folders for a new feature, run the following command:

node script.js [featureName]

## You will be prompted to choose which files to create for the feature:

Service file: This creates a service file for the feature.
Actions file: This creates an actions file for the feature.
Reducer file: This creates a reducer file for the feature.
Simply answer y or n (case-insensitive) for each prompt.

## Example

Let's say we want to create files and folders for a feature called "userManagement". We can run the following command:

node script.js userManagement

The script will guide us through the prompts to select which files to create. Once completed, the necessary files and folders will be generated in the project structure.
